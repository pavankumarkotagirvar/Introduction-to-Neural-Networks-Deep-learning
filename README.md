# Introduction-to-Neural-Networks-Deep-learning
An introductory project demonstrating basic feed-forward neural network concepts, implemented step-by-step.   It’s designed for learners who want a hands-on example of building and training a simple neural network from scratch.

## Overview
This project walks through the fundamentals of neural networks—forward pass, backpropagation, and basic training loops—using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
The repository includes code, notes, and visualizations to make the learning process clearer.
## Features
- Simple feed-forward neural network implementation
- Step-by-step notebook with explanations
- Easy to extend for new datasets
- Visualizations of training progress and accuracy
